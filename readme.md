# Portfolio Website

My current [portfolio website](https://www.carloscastillo.io) detailing information about me like my projects and social media

## Motivation

To have more of an online precense and means for people to contact me and view my work. I also used it as an opportunity to practice using webpack and threejs. This is my third iteration of creating a portfolio website, the depricated versions are also on my github if you would like to take a peek at them

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* [Threejs](https://threejs.org/) - is a 3D library that tries to make it as easy as possible to get 3D content on a webpage
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
* Heroku
* HTML5
* CSS3
